    psycopg2-sample.py
    Jeff Ondich, 23 April 2016

    A very short, demo of how to use psycopg2 to connect to
    and query a PostgreSQL database. This demo assumes a "books"
    database like the one I've used in CS257 for the past few years,
    including an authors table with fields

        (id, given_name, surname, birth_year, death_year)

    You might also want to consult the official psycopg2 tutorial
    at https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Psycopg2_Tutorial.

    Also, SEE THE NOTE BELOW ABOUT config.py. It's important.
'''
import sys
import psycopg2

# We're also going to import our postgres username, password,
# and database from a file named config.py, like so:
import config

# Here are steps you should take to make this "import config" work properly.
#
# 1. DO THIS IMMEDIATELY, DON'T WAIT! Create a .gitignore file in the
#    directory containing your python program (I've already done so for this
#    sample directory). Your .gitignore file should contain this line:
#
#     config.py
#
# 2. Create a config.py file in this directory, containing three
#    assignment statements:
#
#     database = 'YOUR_DATABASE_NAME'  (whatever your database name is, like 'books')
#     user = 'YOUR_POSTGRES_USER_NAME'
#     password = 'YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD_IF_ANY'
#
# 3. That's it, congratulations! You have now made your postgres login information
#    available to your python program, but you've prevented that information from
#    getting accidentally pushed to your git repository. Keeping your login info
#    out of your public repos (or your private ones, for that matter) will go a long
#    way towards avoiding one of the most obvious and bone-headed security problems.

        This function introduces an important security issue. Suppose you
        have information provided by your user (e.g. a search string)
        that needs to become part of your SQL query. Since you can't trust
        users not to be malicious, nor can you trust them not to do weird and
        accidentally destructive things, you need to be very careful about
        how you use any input they provide. To avoid the very common and
        very dangerous security attack known as "SQL Injection", we will use
        the parameterized version of cursor.execute whenever we're using
        user-generated data. See below for how that goes. '''
