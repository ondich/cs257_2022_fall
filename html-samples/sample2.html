        <h1>This is an h1 heading. Read the next paragraph carefully.</h1>
        <p>Open both sample2.html and sample2.css in your text editor,
            and play around with both, editing and saving to see what happens.
            Generally, when you change the CSS, you have to "force-reload" to prevent your 
            browser from just using its cached copy of sample2.css. Sometimes you
            have to force-reload multiple times until the browser gets the hint.
            This is super-annoying. For most browsers, you can force-reload via
            Shift-Ctrl-R (Windows and Linux) or Shift-Command-R (Mac).</p>

        <h2>This is an h2 heading</h2>

        <h3>Using CSS classes</h3>
        <p>These paragraphs illustrate how you can use
        the <em>class</em> attribute for a tag
        (e.g. &lt;p class="something"&gt;) and a corresponding
        CSS selector + declaration to specify the style
        for that class).</p>

        <p>Hi there. This is a normal happy paragraph.</p>
        <p class="alarming">This is an alarming paragraph with
            one class.</p>
        <p>This is not an alarming paragraph.</p>
        <p class="alarming big">This is a super-alarming paragraph
            with two classes.</p>
        
        <h3>Another tag</h3>
        <p>How did we get this list to show letters instead of
            numbers? What would happen if you gave one
            of the &lt;li&gt; tags an "alarming" class?
            What if you made &lt;ol&gt; alarming?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Other item</li>
            <li>Some other item</li>
        </ol>
