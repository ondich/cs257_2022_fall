    <h1>Cascading style sheets</h1>
    <p>Your job this time is to learn some CSS basics for adjusting colors, sizes,
    fonts, and backgrounds.</p>

    <h2>Styling paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Here's some text in a normal paragraph tag.</p>

    <p class="important">Here's some text in a paragraph with class "important". Look at the HTML
    and the CSS to see how we make it look important.</p>

    <p class="resize_me">This paragraph has class "resize_me". Try editing the CSS for this
    class using the various size units provided by CSS. (Search "css size units" for
    some help. Units include px, pt, in, cm, mm, em, rem, ex, %, and more.)</p>

    <p class="indented">This is an indented paragraph. I'm just going to keep typing
    so it will be long enough to wrap onto a second line. I wonder if this is long
    enough yet. There's a woodpecker trying to bring down a tree on my patio, one head-bang
    at a time. (Is this long enough now?)</p>

    <p class="indented important">This paragraph is both indented and important. I'm just going to keep typing
    so it will be long enough to wrap onto a second line. I wonder if this is long
    enough yet. There's a woodpecker trying to bring down a tree on my patio, one head-bang
    at a time. (Is this long enough now?)</p>

    <p class="important">Can you have two HTML elements with the same class?</p>

    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p class="special_color">Try changing the background and text color for this paragraph to various values.
    Note that there are some built-in color names (like "red", "green", "purple", etc.), but you can also
    specify colors using 2 hexadecimal digits for the red, green, and blue components of the color you want.
    Since 2-digit hexadecimal numbers range from 00 to FF (0 to 255 in base ten), you can get a very bright
    purple with #xFF00FF (that is, the maximum red and the maximum blue, with no green at all), or a more
    muted and darker purple with #x990099). Search for "css color chart" or something like that to see some
    handy images.</p>
    
    <h2>Styling headings</h2>
    <p>Can you change the styles of an h2 tag the same way we changed it for paragraphs?
    Experiment with that. For example, try making this section's h2 tag red and 50% bigger
    than a default h2 tag.</p>

    <h2>Styling tables</h2>
    
    <p>Here's a table</p>
    <table>
    <tr><th></th><th>Antlers?</th><th>Wings?</th><th>Noisy?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Crow</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moose</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moth</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's another table</p>
    <table>
    <tr><th></th><th>Antlers?</th><th>Wings?</th><th>Noisy?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Seagull</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Elk</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Sometimes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moth</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No, but kinda creepy</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Those cell borders make all the interior lines look doubled-up. Can you
    search to figure out how to fix that so there are just single lines between
    cells? Try applying that change just to the second table.</p>

    <h2>class versus id</h2>
    <p class="important" id="class_vs_id">Any HTML element can have a <em>class</em> attribute, an <em>id</em>
    attribute, both, or neither. The difference is that many elements can share a class, while only
    one element in a page is allowed to have any given id. Take a look at the CSS to see how
    this paragraph is styled, and how the styles for the "important" class are combined with the styles for
    the "class_vs_id" id.</p>

    <h2>Inline styles</h2>
    <p>You can apply a style to <span class="important">just some inline text</span> using the <em>span</em> tag.</p>

    <h2>Page margins</h2>
    <p>See how this page jams right up to the bottom of the browser with no margin (at least it does
    for me)? How could you add a little space at the bottom of the page to prevent this?</p>
