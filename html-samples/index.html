    <h3>Introductory HTML/CSS samples</h3>
    <p>This page links to a few HTML/CSS samples to help you get started.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get these files onto your computer. The easiest way to do that
            is to clone <a href="https://github.com/ondich/cs257_2022_fall.git">GitHub repository for this class</a>
            and then look in the html-samples directory.</li>
        <li>For each sample:
            <ul>
                <li>Use File-&gt;Open in your browser to open the sampleX.html file. (Alternatively,
                    double-click on the HTML file, which should open the browser.</li>
                <li>Right-click on the resulting browser page and select "View Page Source", which
                    will show you the raw HTML in a new tab.</li>
                <li>If there are CSS or Javascript files listed in the &lt;head&gt; section
                    of the raw HTML, click on their links to get those files open in separate tabs.</li>
                <li>Read the HTML. What do you expect it to do.</li>
                <li>Think of things you'd like to try changing in these samples, then open the HTML and CSS
                    files in your text editor. Play around with the HTML and/or the CSS and save your changes.</li>
                <li>Reload the page in the browser. Generally, when you change the CSS, you have
                    to "force-reload" to prevent your browser from just using its cached copy of the
                    .css file. Sometimes you have to force-reload multiple times until the browser gets the hint.
                    This is super-annoying. For most browsers, you can force-reload via
                    Shift-Ctrl-R (Windows and Linux) or Shift-Command-R (Mac). If that doesn't work,
                    check the internet for guidance.</p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Keep track of your questions and if you get stuck, ask in class or on Slack.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the samples.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="sample0.html">sample0.html</a>: The minimal
            file structure for an HTML page. No CSS.</li>
        <li><a href="sample1.html">sample1.html</a>: A demo
            of a bunch of basic HTML tags, including paragraphs,
            links, headings, images, lists, etc. No CSS.</li>
        <li><a href="sample2.html">sample2.html</a>: Introduction
            to CSS styles applied to tags and to classes.
            Depends on <a href="sample2.css">sample2.css</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="sample3.html">sample3.html</a>: Longer

            suggestions.
            Depends on <a href="sample3.css">sample3.css</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="sample4.html">sample4.html</a>: my little
            "navigation bar" sample, showing how styling can
            make substantial presentation changes to content
            like an unordered list of links.
            Depends on <a href="sample4.css">sample4.css</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="sample5.html">sample5.html</a>: layout
            with CSS.

        <li><a href="sample6.html">sample6.html</a>: layout
            with CSS Flexbox.

    </ul>

    <h3>Resources for getting to know HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>There is a ton of tutorial information online
        about HTML and CSS. Here are a few suggested
        starting points.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Obvious: search for "CSS [concept I'm looking for]"
            or "HTML 5 [concept]"</li>
        <li>Excellent beginner and intermediate <a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/">tutorials from HTML Dog</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a>: 
            very good
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials">tutorials</a>,
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference">references</a>, etc.</li>
        <li><a href="https://w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>: 
            very good tutorials, references, etc.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3fools.com/">w3fools.com</a>: used to
            say that w3schools was terrible and that everybody should use
            MDN instead, but now think w3schools has gotten better.
            Sounds like some public pressure may have helped
            w3schools fix its problems.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics">CSS tutorial</a> from MDN</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS tutorial</a>
            from w3schools.com</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp">Colors in CSS</a> from w3schools.com</li>
        <li>The<a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>
            (W3C) is the official standards organization for lots of
            web-related protocols, languages, and tools, including
            HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li>Watch out: W3C != w3schools.com. There's no formal connection
            between these two organizations, and sometimes the W3C
            people can be a little bit cranky about the confusion.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
