BACKGROUND

There are *many* graph-drawing libraries. A few months ago, I hunted around for one that would be relatively painless to include in a simple project, and I landed on Chartist. So the samples here are Chartist samples. Pretty easy to learn, pretty good website, etc. But if you like some other system better, go wild.

Chartist's samples are here: https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/examples.html

My samples:

simple-charts.html -- slight adaptation of a couple of Chartist's own samples.


bar-chart-from-api.html -- grabbing data from an API and inserting it into a Chartist bar chart. This is a stripped-down version of a project I made for myself so I could watch COVID-19 stats in a format that I like and can control. Many thanks to the COVID Tracking Project for their API. https://covidtracking.com/data/api


USING THESE SAMPLES

Just open the HTML files in a browser and poke around. Read the HTML, the CSS, and the JS.
